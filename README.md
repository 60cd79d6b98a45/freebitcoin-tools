# Freebitco.in and freedoge.co.in helper utilities for Multiply BTC

Scripts won't affect freebitco.in behavior in any way.  

Usage:
- Goto "Multiply BTC" on the site.
- Copy js file content and paste it in the browser console.


**Warning:**  
_You still need to come up with your own strategy. Do it at your own risk. I'm not responsible for any losses._  
_Betting comes with **serious risks** for your satoshis. Do it for fun and only with what you can afford to lose._


## auto-populate.js
Auto populates MuliplyBTC values with the values from `faucets` variable.  
Use `faucets.bitcoin` for freebitco.in and `faucets.dogecoin` for freedoge.co.in
Values are self explanatory and match the field you'll see on the site.
